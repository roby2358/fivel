# From a 1944 CIA manual on destabilization strategies
= Destabilize
  - Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
  - Make "speeches." Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.
  - When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committee as large as possible - never less than five.
  - Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
  - Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.
  - Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
  - Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable"and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
  - In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers.
  - Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw.
  - To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.
  - Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.
  - Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.
  - Work slowly.
  - Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can.
  - Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.
  - Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.
