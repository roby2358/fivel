  - some mystery (but not only a taste in one or two chapters)
  - some complexity but not too much (in case readers have early Alzheimer)
  - the right number of characters, with up to date names and attitudes
  - some young, some old characters - everyone needs to be represented
  - some exotic venues (money-bags venues best)
  - stressful situation
  - some humour (making sure it is fairly international)
  - some very plain speaking (swearing if necessary) so that the reader feels at home
  - some vague philosophical input, but lite-lite to make all readers feel competent
