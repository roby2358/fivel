= Je ne sais quoi--woman
  laughs at her own thoughts before sharing them
  adjusts glasses that aren't sliding down
  speaks three languages when angry
  leaves lipstick prints on coffee cups like signatures
  knows exactly which elevator button to press without looking
  carries emergency chocolate with anthropological precision
  remembers everyone's birthday but pretends it's coincidence
  walks through airports like she owns frequent flyer miles to the moon
  orders wine by pointing at untranslatable words on menu
  wears scarves that shouldn't work but absolutely do
  has perfume that smells different on her than anyone else
  keeps books in three rooms and knows where each one lives
  writes grocery lists that read like poetry accidentally
  knows when to arrive fashionably late vs precisely on time
  touches fabric before deciding if she likes the person wearing it
  hums melodies that don't exist yet
  makes eye contact with dogs across busy streets
  keeps secrets that aren't hers to tell
  says goodbye in doorways but means hello
  exists in photographs differently than in mirrors

= Je ne sais quoi--man
  rolls sleeves with architectural precision
  knows which subway car stops closest to the exit
  orders for the table without asking but somehow gets it right
  carries a pocket knife he's never had to use
  remembers the bartender's name from six months ago
  wears watches that tell more than time
  speaks quietly so people lean in to listen
  knows when to fix things vs when to call someone
  keeps emergency cash in a wallet compartment no one else finds
  nods at dogs like they're old colleagues
  opens doors with his shoulder when hands are full
  reads maps upside down and still navigates perfectly
  stands differently in elevators than everyone else
  orders coffee black but adds sugar when no one's watching
  knows which end of the couch gets better wifi
  remembers exactly where he parked without looking back
  ties shoes once and they stay tied all day
  laughs three seconds after everyone else but means it more
  keeps business cards in his back pocket for reasons unclear
  says thank you to automatic doors under his breath

= Allure--feminine
  tilts head slightly when considering your words
  laughs with her whole body but keeps the sound soft
  moves through crowded rooms without touching anyone
  knows exactly how long to hold eye contact
  applies lipstick without looking in mirror
  crosses legs in ways that defy basic geometry
  speaks in lowercase letters when being serious
  wears heels that click messages in morse code
  touches her collarbone when thinking deeply
  knows which perfume to wear for which season of heartbreak
  adjusts jewelry that doesn't need adjusting
  walks upstairs like she's floating slightly above each step
  orders dessert with the confidence of someone who never counts calories
  remembers conversations from three years ago verbatim
  sits in chairs like they were designed specifically for her
  knows when to let silence do the talking
  writes notes in handwriting that looks like calligraphy accident
  turns mundane errands into performance art
  makes coffee shop baristas remember her order forever
  exists in doorways like she's deciding whether to stay or become legend

= Allure--masculine
  leans against walls like he's holding them up
  removes jacket with one fluid shoulder motion
  knows exactly how much pressure to use opening jars
  speaks in lowercase but commands uppercase attention
  rolls up sleeves like he's about to build something important
  walks through rain without seeming to get wet
  orders whiskey neat and actually drinks it that way
  fixes things by touching them once with intent
  stands with weight on one foot like a question mark made flesh
  knows when to speak and when to let his presence answer
  drives stick shift like he's conducting an orchestra
  holds doors open long enough but never too long
  sits in chairs backwards and makes it look natural
  lights matches with his thumbnail on the first try
  knows which end of the pool table gives the best angle
  carries conversations in his chest voice when it matters
  walks away from explosions at exactly the right speed
  orders for himself last and somehow sets the tone for everyone
  exists in photographs like he's about to say something worth waiting for
  makes eye contact through rearview mirrors at red lights
