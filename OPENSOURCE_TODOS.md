Can you take a look at https://github.com/roby2358/fivel and produce a checklist of to do's to open source it? Skip the src/main/resources/tables directory. That just has data tables.

Below is a pragmatic‐yet‐slightly-haunted roadmap for turning fivel from “my weekend science-project that accidentally became self-aware” into a bona-fide open-source citizen. I’ve skipped src/main/resources/tables per your diktat.

Pick a grown-up license – The current file is a hand-rolled, MIT-ish incantation that screams garage-lab energy but isn’t the canonical MIT text
github.com
. Swap it for an OSI-approved license verbatim (MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL-family depending on viral-ness appetite) so downstream lawyers don’t get the night sweats.

Expand the README into an atlas, not a post-it – At the moment it’s essentially a warning label plus a couple of run commands
github.com
. Flesh it out with: project purpose; high-level architecture; feature list; quick-start (HTTP + MCP); troubleshooting; and shiny screenshots/GIFs. Think “README as elevator pitch and operations manual.”

Create CONTRIBUTING.md & CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md – Spell out how to file issues, branch naming, commit style, PR review process, and the social contract for not being a jerk. GitHub will surface these automatically when outsiders open PRs.

Add SECURITY.md – Describe how to report vulns privately and your disclosure timeline. Even toys deserve responsible disclosure.

Wire up CI – A simple GitHub Actions workflow that caches the sbt dependency graph, compiles against Scala 3.3.6, runs the MUnit + ScalaMock test suite, and produces the fat-jar via sbt assembly ensures outsiders don’t break the build. (Your build file already defines the assembly settings and dependencies
github.com
.)

Publish artifacts – Decide whether to push jars to Maven Central or merely attach them to GitHub Releases. Either way, tag version 0.1.0, generate release notes, and let CI upload the jar automatically.

Scrub secrets & local paths – Audit every config, especially anything under src/main/resources (excluding your tables), for hard-coded paths, tokens, API keys, or location-specific absolute paths. Replace them with environment vars or .env exemplars committed as *.example.

Document MCP integration thoroughly – The README hints at Claude Desktop configs, but open-source newcomers won’t have that context. Provide a docs/ folder (or wiki) with exact JSON snippets and a miniature walkthrough (“curl localhost:8000/mcp with this JSON to roll a table”).

Automate code style – Drop in scalafmt and scalafix configs; enforce them in CI. It keeps drive-by contributors from re-ligating every brace.

Generate & host ScalaDoc – Enable doc in your sbt pipeline and publish the generated HTML pages through GitHub Pages so newcomers can browse API surfaces without cloning.

Add issue & PR templates – Short forms asking “what did you expect, what happened, reproduction steps” reduce psychic overhead for both maintainers and wanderers.

Version & dependency hygiene – Pin dependency versions (your build.sbt already does) and enable the GitHub Dependabot to watch for CVEs.

Badge‐ify the repo – Build status, license type, latest release, and Maven-Central coordinates badges give instant credibility on the GitHub front page.

Optional containerization – A slim Dockerfile (FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre) that runs fivel.jar lets folks boot the whole circus with a single docker run -p 8000:8000 fivel:latest.

Prune ignorable cruft – .gitignore already zaps IDE files and target/
github.com
, but double-check for OS X .DS_Store or rogue log dumps that leaked into history. Rewrite history with git filter-repo if needed.

First-timer friendly issues – Label a few entry-level bugs as good first issue and add helpful context. Instant community magnet.

Release announcement – Draft a short blog post or GitHub Discussion explaining why the world needs a “table-rolling server” and inviting collaborators. Melancholy futurism optional; earnest absurdity encouraged.

Complete these rites, light the CI incense, and you’ll have transformed fivel from a private cabinet of curiosities into a public playground—ready for forks, stars, and whatever eldritch innovations the internet bestows.
