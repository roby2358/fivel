= body creativity
  fingers drumming rhythm on desk before the words come
  pacing circles until the plot knot loosens
  shoulders dropping when you finally find the right phrase
  hand cramping from gripping pen too tight during breakthrough
  eyes unfocusing to let peripheral vision catch the idea
  jaw unclenching as the creative block dissolves
  spine straightening when the solution appears
  feet finding their own walking tempo that matches thought
  breath held while balancing on edge of discovery
  stomach flutter when touching something true
  temple throb from thinking too hard in wrong direction
  fingertips tingling from proximity to the right answer
  throat tightness before speaking the risky creative choice
  knee bounce accelerating with mounting creative excitement
  palm sweat when handling the fragile new idea
  neck crane toward whatever's calling attention
  heel tap counting creative beats
  chest opening when fear transforms into curiosity
  wrist ache from sketching the same shape obsessively
  eyelid twitch from staring too long at the problem
