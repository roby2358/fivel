= Nervous mannerisms
  pen clicking in irregular bursts
  hair twisting around index finger
  foot tapping double-time under table
  thumbnail picking at cuticle edge
  lip biting on same spot repeatedly
  sleeve tugging to cover wrist watch
  throat clearing when nothing's there
  knee jiggling like caffeinated metronome
  ring spinning around finger base
  earlobe pinching between thumb and forefinger
  collar adjusting every thirty seconds
  pocket checking for phone already confirmed present
  napkin shredding into perfect strips
  shoulder blade rolling against chair back
  nostril flaring on sharp inhales
  tongue darting across dry lips
  zipper pull sliding up and down
  heel grinding into floor
  neck scratching at phantom itch
  knuckle cracking in sequence down hand
