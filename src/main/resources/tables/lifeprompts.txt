# I have one of the neighbor kids over at my house at present, working
# on his college essay. I've been doing this a lot lately (we have a gaggle
# of kids on the block who are all the same age, all grew up together, and
# are now all seniors) and every time it's the same:
# They come in absolutely deer-in-headlights, either with nothing other
# than a handful of crumpled notes or an essay that they can't use because
# it's too long or just not understanding what this kind of writing is for
# or what it's supposed to do. I sit them down on the couch,
# and then we have tea (the tea is essential, obviously). And then I make
# them put their laptop aside, we talk a little bit about life, or worries,
# or the world. We talk about memories. I have them tell me stories.
# And then I hand them an old notebook, and I start lobbing writing prompts
# at them. I tell them that they don't have to worry about any of this - no
# one will see it. They just have to keep their pencil going for five minutes
# and then stop when the timer goes off.
# I tell them to write about a memory, pretending that it's happening right
# this very second. I have them write about a choice they had to make as though
# it was happening right now. I have them write about food, or work, or the
# bus, or snow.
# I tell them to tell me a story about a time they broke the rules, or tried
# something new, or built something with their friends. We talk about sense
# memory - how we experience the world with our whole body even though we
# don't always realize it. How memory lives in our skin.
# I have them write jokes, treatises, manifestos. I have them make graphic
# essays. Comics. Yard signs. I have them make lists. We talk about verbs.
# We talk about how we know what we know. We talk about the permeable membrane
# between memory and imagination.
# It's such a strange form of writing, for them, and most of them have
# never done anything like it before - writing in their own distinctive voice,
# writing about their own unique experiences, writing a story with themselves
# at the center.
# One kid said, "But how can I write that? Doesn't it need to be *about*
# something?" And I say, "Yes. It is. It's about YOU. What you've written
# is a bunch of paragraphs about your grandma. And she's great! But what
# we need to focus on is YOU."
# They've literally never done this before. It's outside of their experience.
# I have them write in the present tense. I use the word "immediate" a lot.
# We talk about writing as a three-dimensional experience. But mostly, I
# just have them write. Over and over. Quick and messy.
# Invariably, there's a moment. They will have pages and pages of material.
# Memories. Moments. Thoughts. Arguments. Explanations. Seeing their point
# of view as something that belongs entirely to them. And then they see it.
# An arc. A beginning, middle and end. "Oh!" they say.
# I tell them, "You are the world's leading expert on YOU. And that can
# be hard because you don't know yourself all that well. That's our job as
# human beings, to understand ourselves so we can understand the world. Other
# people might have insight and knowledge of you,
# and sometimes they might even understand aspects of your self or personality
# or life that even you don't really know. But the only person who can possibly
# know the fundamental YOU-ness of you. So you get to write that with confidence
# and authority. You're the expert."
