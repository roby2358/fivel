  Which explains why
  Apparently
  So far
  Either that or
  Unfortunately
  And the good news is
  Which means
  I know what you're all thinking
  If everything goes well
  It's official
  Don't get excited
  Before you judge
  At least that's what
  It makes sense when you realize
  Which confirms everyone's suspicions

  But critics say
  In keeping with tradition
  In keeping with regulation
  Without giving too much away
  That's better than their usual response
  It's all a misunderstanding
  I think the standards have lowered a bit because
  Now, he's overcompensating
  The working nickname is
